# How to Update and Maintain the Base Environment

**Version:** 1.2 (October 2025) - Updated for setup_base_env.sh v3.8
**Related Files:** `setup_base_env.sh`, `README_setup_base_env.md`

## Overview

This guide provides a comprehensive, reusable prompt for adding packages and maintaining the sophisticated data science environment. Use this every time you need to update the environment to ensure consistency with the smart constraints and conflict resolution system.

**v3.8 Update:** Hybrid snapshot strategy implemented. Small venvs (<500MB) use full compressed snapshots with pigz. Large venvs (≥500MB) use fast metadata-only snapshots (~100KB, ~1 second). Intelligent rollback handles both types seamlessly.

**v3.7 Update:** Critical bug fixes. Python version mismatch detection corrected. Script no longer hangs on snapshot creation for large environments.

**v3.6 Update:** Comprehensive verbose logging added with --verbose flag for detailed command execution and timing.

**v3.5 Update:** The `--update` mode now fully applies updates that test as safe. Venv recreates automatically when Python version changes. Version checks correctly detect actual versions (not "stable" placeholders).

```
I need to add/update packages in my comprehensive data science environment and ensure everything is current and conflict-free.

PACKAGES TO ADD/UPDATE:
- [package1]
- [package2]
- [package3]

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Work 100% consistently with the sophisticated smart constraints and conflict resolution system documented in @README_setup_base_env.md

2. VERIFICATION & TESTING:
   - Check if packages already exist in base-env/requirements.in
   - Verify current installation status in base-env/.venv
   - Run setup_base_env.sh with --adaptive flag for intelligent conflict resolution
   - **SAFETY FEATURES (v3.8)**: Script automatically creates hybrid snapshots (full or metadata) before changes
     - Small venvs (<500MB): Full compressed snapshot with pigz
     - Large venvs (≥500MB): Fast metadata-only snapshot (~100KB, ~1 second)
     - Intelligent rollback handles both types seamlessly
   - Optional: Use --verbose flag for detailed command execution logging
   - Test each new/updated package installation and basic functionality
   - Check for package conflicts using pip check
   - Document any conflicts found (breaking vs. non-breaking)
   - **CRITICAL: Check if old conflicts are now resolvable:**
     * Try upgrading packages with known conflicts to latest versions
     * Verify if smart constraints can be relaxed with newer package versions
     * Document investigation results even if conflicts remain unresolvable
     * Preserve working state - revert if new versions create more conflicts

3. ENVIRONMENT UPDATES:

```

### Scenario 4: Checking for Latest Versions with Update Mode (FULLY AUTONOMOUS)

**Command:**
```bash
cd /path/to/your/environments/directory
./setup_base_env.sh --update
```

**What this does:**
- **Part 0: Homebrew Update** - Updates Homebrew package database first
- **Part 1: Comprehensive Toolchain Check** - Checks ALL environment components:
  - pyenv, Python, pip, pip-tools (FULLY automatic updates)
  - R, Julia (FULLY automatic install/upgrade via brew)
  - System dependencies: libgit2, libpq, openssl@3 (FULLY automatic brew upgrades)
- **Part 2: Python Package Check** - Checks all Python packages for latest versions
- **Part 3A: Apply Toolchain Updates (FULLY AUTONOMOUS)** - Applies toolchain updates immediately:
  - **Always applies toolchain updates** (pyenv, Python, pip/pip-tools, R, Julia, system deps)
  - **Independent of package tests** - toolchain is always safe to update
  - **Graceful error handling** for each component
- **Part 3B: Apply Package Updates (Only if Tests Pass)** - Tests and applies package updates:
  - Creates temporary test environments to verify package compatibility
  - **ONLY applies package updates if ALL tests pass** - ensures maximum stability
  - When tests pass: Updates requirements.in with latest compatible versions
  - When tests fail: Keeps current package versions (toolchain already updated in Part 3A)
  - **FULLY AUTONOMOUS** - no prompts or confirmations required:
    * pyenv via Homebrew
    * Python via pyenv
    * pip and pip-tools
    * R via Homebrew
    * Julia via Homebrew
    * System dependencies via Homebrew
    * Python packages via requirements.in
  - **Graceful error handling** - Continues on non-critical failures
  - **Refuses to apply updates** if any test fails and explains why
  - Restores original configuration if conflicts are detected
  - Automatically enables adaptive mode for intelligent conflict resolution

**When to use:**
- Monthly or quarterly comprehensive environment maintenance
- Before starting new projects
- After major Python, R, Julia, Homebrew, or package updates
- When you suspect old toolchain or package conflicts might be resolved

**Expected output:**
```

   - Pip version pinning (pip < 25.2)

3. **Conflict Resolution**
   - Two-tier strategy (Fast/Adaptive)
   - Backtracking prevention
   - Dynamic resolver with 4 strategies

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Issue: pip-tools compatibility error
**Solution:** Ensure `pip < 25.2` is pinned in setup_base_env.sh (line 316)

#### Issue: Merge conflicts when pushing
**Solution:** Always preserve local sophisticated system features:
```bash
git checkout --ours setup_base_env.sh .gitignore
git checkout --theirs [files from remote]
```

#### Issue: Package conflicts detected
**Solution:**
1. Run with `--adaptive` flag first
2. If unresolved, add smart constraint to requirements.in
3. Document in README if it's a new known issue

## 🛡️ Production-Grade Safety Features

The setup script now includes comprehensive safety features to ensure fail-safe installations:

### Automatic Protection During Updates

**Pre-flight Checks:**
- Validates disk space (10GB minimum), internet connectivity, and write permissions
- Loads existing installation metadata if available
- Fails fast before making any changes if issues detected

**Hybrid Snapshot Strategy (v3.8):**
- **Intelligent size-based selection** of snapshot method
- **Small venvs (<500MB):** Full compressed snapshot
  - Uses pigz for parallel compression (4-5x faster)
  - Excludes *.pyc and __pycache__ for smaller archives
  - Complete instant rollback via tar extraction
- **Large venvs (≥500MB):** Metadata-only snapshot
  - Saves pip freeze, requirements files, pyvenv.cfg (~100KB)
  - Fast rollback via pip-sync (leverages pip cache)
  - Prevents 30+ minute hangs on large environments
- Automatically cleans up old snapshots (keeps 2 most recent of each type)

**Intelligent Automatic Rollback (v3.8):**
- Error trapping enabled during installation (`set -e` and `trap`)
- **Tries metadata snapshot first** (faster, uses pip-sync)
- **Falls back to full archive** if available
- Removes failed environment and restores working state
- Shows clear error message and restored environment details

**Post-Installation Health Checks:**
- Validates Python interpreter functionality
- Tests critical package imports (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, jupyter, ipykernel)
- Checks Jupyter kernel availability
- Reports environment size
- Prompts for user confirmation if critical checks fail

**Installation Metadata Tracking:**
- Records in `.env_metadata.json`:
  - Last successful install timestamp
  - Operating system (platform, type, architecture)
  - Python and pip versions
  - Package count
  - Conflict status
  - Installation mode (fast/adaptive)

**Cross-Platform Compatibility:**
- Automatically detects macOS or Linux
- Adjusts commands for platform-specific differences
- Supports multiple Linux distributions (Ubuntu, RHEL, Fedora, etc.)
- Detects and configures appropriate shell (zsh, bash, sh)
- Platform-specific package manager support (Homebrew, apt, yum, dnf)

### What This Means for You

**Safety Guarantees:**
- ✅ Your working environment is never lost
- ✅ Failed installations automatically rollback
- ✅ Can manually restore from recent snapshots if needed
- ✅ Installation history is tracked

**Excluded from Git:**
```
.venv.snapshot_*.metadata/    # Metadata snapshot directories
.venv.snapshot_*.tar.gz       # Full archive snapshots
.venv.snapshot_*.tar.gz.meta  # Archive metadata files
.env_metadata.json            # Installation metadata
*.log                         # Log files
```

**Manual Rollback (if needed):**
```bash
cd base-env
rm -rf .venv

# For metadata snapshot:
ls -td .venv.snapshot_*.metadata | head -1
python -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install pip-tools
.venv/bin/pip-sync .venv.snapshot_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.metadata/pip-freeze.txt

# For full archive snapshot:
ls -t .venv.snapshot_*.tar.gz | head -1
tar -xzf .venv.snapshot_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.tar.gz

source .venv/bin/activate
```

## 🎓 Recent Improvements & Lessons Learned

### October 2025: Hybrid Snapshot Strategy (v3.8)

**Enhancement:**
- Completely redesigned snapshot system to prevent hanging while maintaining rollback capability
- Size-based strategy: full snapshots for small venvs, metadata-only for large venvs
- Intelligent rollback handles both snapshot types seamlessly

**Implementation:**
- Added `create_metadata_snapshot()` function for large venvs (≥500MB)
- Added `create_full_snapshot()` function for small venvs (<500MB)
- Enhanced `rollback_to_snapshot()` to try metadata first, fall back to archive
- Updated `cleanup_old_snapshots()` to manage both snapshot types
- Uses pigz for parallel compression when available (4-5x faster)
- Excludes *.pyc and __pycache__ files for smaller archives

**Benefits:**
- No more 30+ minute hangs on 1GB+ environments
- ~100KB storage vs 200-300MB for large environments
- ~1 second snapshot time vs 30+ minutes
- Full rollback capability maintained for all environment sizes
- Optimized compression for small environments

**Your Environment (1025MB):**
- Uses metadata-only snapshots
- ~1 second to create vs 30+ minutes before
- Fast rollback via pip-sync leveraging pip cache

**Lesson Learned:**
Snapshot strategies should adapt to environment size. What works for small environments (full backup) doesn't scale to large ones. Hybrid approach provides both speed and safety.

### October 2025: Critical Bug Fixes (v3.7)

**Bug #1: Python Version Mismatch False Positive**
- **Problem:** Script was comparing version number with file path
- **Root Cause:** `grep "version"` matched both "version = 3.13.9" and path containing "/versions/"
- **Fix:** Changed to `grep "^version "` (anchored to start of line)
- **Result:** No more false positive warnings

**Bug #2: Script Hanging on Snapshot Creation**
- **Problem:** Script hung for 30+ minutes trying to compress 1GB+ venvs
- **Root Cause:** `tar czf .venv` was compressing entire environment
- **Fix:** Added size check, skip snapshot if > 1GB (later improved to hybrid strategy in v3.8)
- **Result:** Script no longer hangs

**Lesson Learned:**
Operations that work fine at small scale can become bottlenecks at large scale. Always test with realistic environment sizes.

### October 2025: Verbose Logging (v3.6)

**Enhancement:**
- Added --verbose flag for detailed command execution logging
- Implemented `log_verbose()`, `run_logged()`, `start_stage()`, `end_stage()` functions
- Enhanced Python venv recreation with 10+ verbose checkpoints

**Benefits:**
- Full debugging visibility when needed
- Command execution tracking with exit codes
- Stage timing for performance analysis
- Helps diagnose issues like Python version mismatches

**Usage:**
```bash
./setup_base_env.sh --update --verbose
```

**Lesson Learned:**
Verbose logging is essential for debugging complex multi-step scripts. Having detailed execution traces makes it much easier to identify issues.

### October 2025: Comprehensive Package Additions (21 packages)

**Enhancement:**
- Added 21 packages from PedagogicalEngine comprehensive requirements
- Total direct packages increased from 125 to 146
- All new packages verified for compatibility with existing environment

**Packages Added:**
1. **NLP & Embeddings (5)**: sentence-transformers, textstat, fuzzywuzzy, python-levenshtein, rapidfuzz
2. **ML & Clustering (2)**: hdbscan, umap-learn
3. **Testing (3)**: pytest-xdist, pytest-timeout, coverage
4. **Documentation (2)**: sphinx, sphinx-rtd-theme
5. **Content Processing (2)**: xmltodict, pdfplumber
6. **Web & API (2)**: PyGithub, webdriver-manager
7. **Development (3)**: isort, notebook, pydantic-settings
8. **Graph Databases (1)**: neo4j-driver
9. **Apple Silicon (1)**: mlx (conditional, ARM64 only)

**Implementation:**
- Organized by category in requirements.in to maintain structure
- Added appropriate version constraints where needed
- Updated all documentation to reflect new packages
- Maintained 100% consistency across all 3 files

**Benefits:**
- Complete coverage for PedagogicalEngine project requirements
- Enhanced NLP capabilities with sentence transformers and fuzzy matching
- Better testing infrastructure with parallel execution and timeouts
- Professional documentation generation with Sphinx
- Improved PDF and XML processing capabilities
- Apple Silicon optimization support

**Lesson Learned:**
Periodically review project-specific requirements to identify missing packages in the base environment. Comprehensive coverage prevents dependency issues when starting new projects.

### October 2025: gremlinpython Conflict Resolution

**Issue Identified:**
- gremlinpython was excluded due to documented "aenum dependency conflict"
- Comment stated: "requires aenum<4.0.0 which conflicts with other packages"

**Investigation Results:**
- Deep research revealed aenum 4.0.0 **does not exist** (latest is 3.1.16)
- No Python packages in ecosystem require aenum>=4.0.0
- The documented conflict was based on outdated/false information

**Resolution:**
- Successfully installed gremlinpython 3.7.4 with no conflicts
- Tested basic functionality - all working perfectly
- Package count increased from 101 to 102

**Key Lessons:**
1. **Periodically Re-test "Known Conflicts"** - Package ecosystems evolve, old conflicts may resolve naturally
2. **Use Dry-run Testing** - `pip install --dry-run` allows safe conflict checking
3. **Document with Timestamps** - Add dates to conflict documentation for future reference
4. **Challenge Assumptions** - Verify documented conflicts are still valid

### October 2025: Auto-upgrade pip in Update Mode

**Enhancement:**
- Previously, pip only upgraded when pip-tools also needed updating
- Now pip is checked and upgraded independently in `--update` mode
- Respects pip<25.2 compatibility constraint for pip-tools

**Implementation:**
- Added separate pip version checking (lines 1398-1414 in setup_base_env.sh)
- Modified update apply section to handle pip-only updates (lines 1684-1702)
- Updated summary reporting to show pip updates independently

**Benefits:**
- Ensures pip is always current within compatibility constraints
- Improves security by keeping pip up to date
- More transparent update reporting

### October 2025: Systematic Smart Constraint Testing

**Enhancement:**
- Added individual testing of all 8 smart constraints in `--update` mode
- Previously only tested all constraints relaxed together
- Now tests each constraint individually to identify which are still necessary

**Implementation:**
- Added PART 2.5 to --update mode (lines 2577-2665 in setup_base_env.sh v3.5)
- Systematically tests each of the 8 smart constraints:
  1. numpy (current: 2.2.6, previously >=1.20.0)
  2. ipywidgets==8.1.7
  3. geemap==0.36.6
  4. plotly (current: 6.3.1, previously ==5.15.0)
  5. panel==1.8.2
  6. bokeh==3.8.0
  7. voila==0.5.11
  8. selenium==4.38.0
- For each constraint:
  - Creates test requirements with only that constraint relaxed
  - Compiles with pip-compile
  - Installs in temporary venv
  - Runs pip check for conflicts
  - Reports if constraint can be relaxed or is still necessary
  - **v3.5+:** Actually applies updates when safe (not just reports)

**Output Example (after adaptive testing):**
```
🔍 SYSTEMATIC SMART CONSTRAINT ANALYSIS
----------------------------------------
Testing each smart constraint individually to identify which are still necessary...

🧪 Testing numpy without version constraint...
  ✅ numpy: Constraint can potentially be RELAXED (no conflicts detected)

🧪 Testing plotly without version constraint...
  ✅ plotly: Constraint can potentially be RELAXED (no conflicts detected)

[... continues for all 8 constraints ...]

📊 SMART CONSTRAINT ANALYSIS RESULTS:
-------------------------------------
✅ Constraints that can potentially be relaxed:
   • numpy (will update to 2.2.6)
   • plotly (will update to 6.3.1)
   • ipywidgets (already at tested version 8.1.7)
   • geemap (already at tested version 0.36.6)
   • panel (already at tested version 1.8.2)
   • bokeh (already at tested version 3.8.0)
   • voila (already at tested version 0.5.11)
   • selenium (already at tested version 4.38.0)

📝 Updating smart constraints that tested safe to relax:
   • numpy: updating to 2.2.6
   • plotly: updating to 6.3.1
```

**Benefits:**
- Identifies false constraints like the gremlinpython issue
- Provides evidence-based recommendations for constraint relaxation
- Prevents unnecessary version locks
- Allows package ecosystem to evolve naturally

**Lesson Learned:**
Just like gremlinpython had a false conflict, smart constraints may become unnecessary over time as package ecosystems evolve. Systematic testing in --update mode ensures we don't keep outdated constraints.
